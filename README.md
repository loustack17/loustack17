# About Me

Hi everyone 😊 I am Lou!

Exploring code and systems is my playground—whether optimizing .NET backends or deploying on Azure. It's not just about deadlines; it's the thrill of debugging frustrations and connecting tech dots that fuels my curiosity. As a lifelong learner, I form strong opinions on tools like CI/CD pipelines and refactor legacy stacks, refining them with every project.

## Professionally

- Building scalable .NET APIs and services, slashing query times from 5 min to 4 sec via SQL optimizations and EF Core for healthcare and finance platforms.
- Deploying on Azure App Service with DevOps CI/CD, reducing deployment times by 30 min and boosting reliability by 40% across biotech and B2B clients.
- Maintaining legacy ASP.NET (MVC/WebForms) systems, refactoring to cut incidents by 30% and support 4+ projects in high-stakes environments.
- Early exposure to frontend (Angular/JS) and databases (SQL Server/PostgreSQL), evolving into full-stack backend focus with Docker and Entity Framework.

## Personally

- Diving into quirky gadgets? Always hunting the latest software plugins, 3C tech toys, or hidden gems that spark innovation—my desk is a mini lab of experiments.
- Fueling up with exactly 2 cups of coffee daily, black, bold, and non-negotiable—it's my ritual for cracking tough code puzzles.
- Mid-tier FPS and survival game enthusiast—strategising escapes in Delta Force or headshots in Valorant keeps my reflexes sharp between deploys.
