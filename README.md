# Hey, I'm Lou 👋

Backend engineer by training, leaning hard into DevOps now.

I started on the app side — .NET APIs, SQL optimization, keeping brownfield systems alive. These days I'm more interested in the *how it ships and stays alive* part: CI/CD pipelines, self-hosted GitLab, production incident response, cloud infrastructure. That's where I'm growing, and that's where I want to go.

Based in Toronto. Aiming for the DevOps → SRE path.

## 🛠️ Where I live now

```
CI/CD        →  Azure DevOps, GitLab CI (self-hosted runners), Docker, Shell scripting
Cloud        →  AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), Azure App Service, Linux (CentOS / RHEL)
Backend      →  C#, .NET (ASP.NET Core / MVC), SQL Server, PostgreSQL
Monitoring   →  Production incident triage, uptime-focused debugging
```

## 💡 What I've actually done

- **CI/CD & deployment** — Built and maintained pipelines on Azure DevOps + self-hosted GitLab CE. Cut release prep by 30+ min. Managed runner availability and resolved pipeline failures.
- **Infrastructure** — Set up AWS (EC2, S3, RDS) for production. Administered GitLab on CentOS VMs + Docker. Contributed to RHEL migration planning.
- **Production reliability** — Responded to live incidents across healthcare, finance, and biotech. Optimized a critical reporting workflow from **3 min → 4 sec** by moving logic to stored procedures.
- **Brownfield systems** — Maintained 4+ .NET production platforms. Delivered features through safe, incremental refactoring without service disruption.

## ☕ When I'm not on-call

- Exactly 2 cups of black coffee a day. Non-negotiable. Load-bearing, even.
- Mid-tier FPS player — Valorant keeps the reflexes sharp between deploys
- Always tinkering with gadgets and software plugins. My desk is basically a mini lab.
